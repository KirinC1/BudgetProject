    <div class= "essentials">
        <h1>Essentials</h1>        
        <p>Living in a seperate house/apartment, I would still have to pay utilities like electricity, internet 
            and more. The average cost of these utilities adds up to <b>$320</b> in California.
        </p>

        <h1>Groceries</h1>
        <p>Purchasing food is a very important part of everyone's life. If I were to go every couple of days and get the essentials of a healthy diet, the average 
            price of food is $13.50 per day. Every month, this would add up to $418 per month. As you can tell, this is a lot more than the cost of utilities.
        </p>

        <h1>Non-essentials</h1>
        <p>Non-essentials such as entertainment is something that people usually don't consider when thinking about a situation like this.
            I feel like I would definitely want to put aside time during something like the shelter in place to enjoy watching a show or purchasing a game that I think that I might really like.
        </p>

        <h1>After One Month</h1>
        <p>Assuming that I wouldn't be paying all of the rent, I think that after one month, I will still be in an okay position. If I was given $1200, subtracting my living expenses which includes groceries and utilities, I would end up having around $462. 
            I could use this money for the non-essentials like entertainment or save this money up for the next month. If I was paying rent, this extra money would go straight towards that, and then the leftover money would be for me to decide.
