        <h1>Job</h1>
        <p>The Job I would plan to apply for after college is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18wO5hRmRpQA3HPg-qqlTM6PnCUyeprpkzxGXpaxs6bM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">
        #2 on my salary sheet</a>. The reason I chose this job because they say that they are very flexible with working at home. During a time like we are in now,
        that is extremely important, especially when company buildings have to shut down and employees can't go to work. Instead, this company lets it's employees have the opportunity
        to work at home, whether it's in a situation like we are in now, or when the employees need to.
        </p>

        <h1>Cost of Living</h1>
        <p>The average cost of living in San Francisco is ~$70,000. This means not accounting for income taxes, I would be left with ~$30,000 after one year because the salary is ~100,000.
            </p>
        
            <h1>Utilities, Groceries, etc.</h1>
            <p>If I were to take into account the amount of money that I would be paying for utilities and groceries, I would be paying about $8,856 a year on them. This means that I would be left with $21,144. Again, this doesn't take into account
                the taxes that would lower my income even more, because I'm not sure how to really use the paycheck calculator.
            </p>

            <h1>Leftover</h1>
            <p>This means that I would have around $1,762 left every month. I think that I would be fine with taking out around 10% ($176) for entertainment such as games, tv, and more. But the rest I would put towards savings and towards student loans.
            </p>

            <h1>2030</h1>
            <p>Assuming that I would put 45% in savings and 45% towards student loans, I would have around $84,576 in savings by the time 2030 comes around. I think this would put me in a very good position if another "big disaster" happens again. 
                The scary part about this is that there can always be terrible things that happen in between that time period that can completely deplete my savings account and I would have to start over again.
